For this Lab, we were told to create two sprites, one that appears in a random place and one that doesn't. I created a bear and a button. The bears job is to collect all the buttons. Using the arrow keys, my bear moves around the screen. I did not get to the collision part with the buttons, but basically what would happen is the bear would collide and then the button would disappear.
